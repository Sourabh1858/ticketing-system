            <h2>Why Use TTS?</h2>
            <p>
                TTS enforces a formal, structured method for managing tasks, feature requests, and bug reports. By tracking all requests through TTS, we prevent the chaos of interrupt-driven workdays and ensure no task gets lost. It provides:

            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">A <strong>clear process</strong> for submitting and tracking requests.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">A <strong>single source of truth</strong> for all ongoing work.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">An <strong>automatic to-do list</strong> that ensures nothing falls through the cracks.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">A <strong>record</strong> of all tasks, priorities, and deadlines for review and audit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using informal methods like direct messaging or emails can lead to tasks being overlooked or forgotten, especially during busy periods. TTS provides structure, accountability, and visibility into all tasks.
