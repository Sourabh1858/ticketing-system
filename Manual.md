TTS - Ticket Tracking System

Usage Manual for the R&D Team

Welcome to the Ticket Tracking System (TTS) at YOUR_DOMAIN. This manual is designed to guide the R&D team on how to effectively use TTS and ensure we streamline our project and task management process.

Why Use TTS?

TTS enforces a formal, structured method for managing tasks, feature requests, and bug reports. By tracking all requests through TTS, we prevent the chaos of interrupt-driven workdays and ensure no task gets lost. It provides:

	•	A clear process for submitting and tracking requests.
	•	A single source of truth for all ongoing work.
	•	An automatic to-do list that ensures nothing falls through the cracks.
	•	A record of all tasks, priorities, and deadlines for review and audit.

Remember: Using informal methods like direct messaging or emails can lead to tasks being overlooked or forgotten, especially during busy periods.

How to Use TTS?

1. Creating a New Ticket

	•	Click on the “New Ticket” link in the menu.
	•	Fill in all the required fields:
	•	Title: Clear and concise description of the issue or request.
	•	Description: Detailed information about the task.
	•	Priority: Set an appropriate priority (Low, Medium, High).
	•	Category: Choose the category (Bug, Feature, Support).
	•	Assigned: Assign the ticket to a team member.
	•	Due Date: Set a deadline if applicable.
	•	Once submitted, the ticket will appear in the My Tasks and List views.

2. Updating or Closing a Ticket

	•	Navigate to the ticket you wish to update.
	•	Update the status (In Progress, Resolved, Closed, etc.).
	•	Add any relevant comments to keep track of discussions or decisions.
	•	When a task is completed, mark the ticket as Closed.

3. Commenting on a Ticket

	•	Scroll down to the comments section of the ticket.
	•	Leave comments to clarify, provide updates, or ask questions.
	•	Use the upvote/downvote functionality to signal the importance of certain updates.

4. Tracking Activity and Searching

	•	Use the List view to track all open and closed tickets.
	•	Search for tickets by keywords, assignees, or status.
	•	The Activity Log provides a historical record of all actions taken.

Guidelines for R&D Team

	•	Always create tickets for new tasks, bugs, or features. Avoid using side channels like direct messages to manage work. This ensures transparency and accountability.
	•	Regularly check your assigned tickets in the My Tasks view. Keep the statuses up to date (In Progress, Resolved, Closed) to reflect your progress.
	•	Provide detailed descriptions and updates in comments to ensure other team members have full visibility.
	•	Prioritize tickets based on their impact. Use the priority levels wisely to keep the team focused on what matters most.
	•	Close tickets promptly when tasks are completed to ensure an up-to-date overview of the project status.

Benefits of Enforcing TTS Usage

	•	Improved Focus: By managing all tasks in one place, TTS prevents interruptions and distractions caused by impromptu requests.
	•	Better Collaboration: Everyone has visibility into what’s happening, making it easier to assist team members when needed.
	•	Accountability: Each task is assignee to a team member with a clear priority and status, making it easier to track progress and meet deadlines.
	•	History of Work: TTS keeps a complete log of all tasks, ensuring you can easily track past decisions and actions.

Enforcing TTS Use

R&D Leads: Ensure that all requests, updates, and communication regarding tasks are handled through TTS. Regularly monitor the system for open tickets and encourage your team to do the same.

Team Members: Regularly check your tickets and keep your statuses updated. Consistently use TTS for all work-related tasks and communications.

By using TTS to its full potential, we’ll streamline our processes, reduce errors, and improve the overall productivity of the R&D team.
